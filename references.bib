	abstract = {Successful bioprinting of hydrogels relies on geometric accuracy and cell viability, both of which are influenced by a number of variable printing parameters. Despite much research aimed at the resulting quality of bioprinted structures, there is no standard method of comparing bioprint results. In this study, we have developed a simple method of assessing the bioprint results from a range of printing parameters in a standardized manner applicable to extrusion-based bioinks. The purpose of the parameter optimization index ({POI}) is to minimize the shear stress acting on the bioink, and thus on the encapsulated cells, while ensuring the maximum geometric accuracy is obtained. Here we demonstrate the use of the {POI} on a blend of 7\% alginate and 8\% gelatin, and test the printing achieved through 25, 27, and 30 gauge print nozzles at 1–6mm/s print speeds, and at 100–250kPa print pressures. In total, we tested 72 printing configurations. Our data shows that for this particular hydrogel blend, the optimum print is obtained with a 30 gauge nozzle, 100kPa print pressure and 4mm/s print speed. The {POI} is intuitive and easy to assess, and could be a useful method across a wide range of 3D bioprinting research and development applications.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional bioprinting uses additive manufacturing techniques for the automated fabrication of hierarchically organized living constructs. The building blocks are often hydrogel-based bioinks, which need to be printed into structures with high shape fidelity to the intended computer-aided design. For optimal cell performance, relatively soft and printable inks are preferred, although these undergo significant deformation during the printing process, which may impair shape fidelity. While the concept of good or poor printability seems rather intuitive, its quantitative definition lacks consensus and depends on multiple rheological and chemical parameters of the ink. This review discusses qualitative and quantitative methodologies to evaluate printability of bioinks for extrusion- and lithography-based bioprinting. The physicochemical parameters influencing shape fidelity are discussed, together with their importance in establishing new models, predictive tools and printing methods that are deemed instrumental for the design of next-generation bioinks, and for reproducible comparison of their structural performance.},

As a consequence of this travelling through the nozzle, shear forces will inevitably be generated upon cells during the extrusion process and have a negative effect on cell viability, proliferation and biological fate of the tissue. In the present study and for the first time in the bioprinting field, flow simulation and cells fate (lysis, necrosis, apoptosis and viable) were consolidated to establish mathematical relationships. We demonstrated that for constant residence time at wall, the higher the wall shear stress values, the lower the viable populations. Furthermore, at constant maximum wall shear stress, the longer the residence time at wall, the lower the viable populations. Regarding the quantification of the damaged fibroblasts (lysis, necrosis and apoptosis) during the microextrusion, lysis was shown to be the prevailing cell death pathway compared to necrosis and apoptosis. Finally, partial least square ({PLS}) modelling was able to correctly predicted viable cells’ population with a high correlation (R2 of 0.859; error of 9.2\%) between predicted and measured viable cells percentage. This model was shown to be predictive over a large range of cells viability (38.5–94\%) with a prediction error of only 9.2\%.},

	abstract = {Bioprinting is a tool increasingly used in tissue engineering laboratories around the world. As an extension to classic tissue engineering, it enables high levels of control over the spatial deposition of cells, materials, and other factors. It is a field with huge promise for the production of implantable tissues and even organs, but the availability of functional bioinks is a barrier to success. Extrusion bioprinting is the most commonly used technique, where high-viscosity solutions of materials and cells are required to ensure good shape fidelity of the printed tissue construct. This is contradictory to hydrogels used in tissue engineering, which are generally of low viscosity prior to cross-linking to ensure cell viability, making them not directly translatable to bioprinting. This review provides an overview of the important rheological parameters for bioinks and methods to assess printability, as well as the effect of bioink rheology on cell viability. Developments over the last five years in bioink formulations and the use of suspended printing to overcome rheological limitations are then discussed.},

Extrusion-based bioprinting is one of the widely employed biofabrication techniques; researchers tend to use it because of its simplicity, affordability and scalability. During the extrusion-based bioprinting process, cells are subjected to mechanical forces of different kinds. Among these mechanical forces, shear stress is of a special significance and concern as it is considered the main cause of cell damage/death. This review covers the principle of extrusion-based bioprinting, and highlights extrusion-based bioprinting induced shear stress, how cells sense it and respond to it. Moreover, it discusses the bioinks that are commonly used in extrusion-based bioprinting along with their properties that have proven to have an effect on process induced shear stress and cell viability. In addition, it discusses, in detail, the relationship between shear stress, cell viability and different material properties and printing parameters. Furthermore, it provides examples of successfully extrusion-based bioprinted 3D tissues.

	abstract = {Tissue regeneration with scaffolds has proven promising for the repair of damaged tissues or organs. Dispensing-based printing techniques for scaffold fabrication have drawn considerable attention due to their ability to create complex structures layer-by-layer. When employing such printing techniques, the flow rate of the biomaterial dispensed from the needle tip is critical for creating the intended scaffold structure. The flow rate can be affected by a number of variables including the material flow behavior, temperature, needle geometry, and dispensing pressure. As such, model equations can play a vital role in the prediction and control of the flow rate of the material dispensed, thus facilitating optimal scaffold fabrication. This paper presents the development of a model to represent the flow rate of medium viscosity alginate dispensed for the purpose of scaffold fabrication, by taking into account the shear and slip flow from a tapered needle. Because the fluid flow behavior affects the flow rate, model equations were also developed from regression of experimental data to represent the flow behavior of alginate. The predictions from both the flow behavior equation and flow rate model show close agreement with experimental results. For varying needle diameters and temperatures, the slip effect occurring at the needle wall has a significant effect on the flow rate of alginate during scaffold fabrication.},

	abstract = {3D-Bioprinting has seen a rapid expansion in the last few years, with an increasing number of reported bioinks. Alginate is a natural biopolymer that forms hydrogels by ionic cross-linking with calcium ions. Due to its biocompatibility and ease of gelation, it is an ideal ingredient for bioinks. This review focuses on recent advances on bioink formulations based on the combination of alginate with other polysaccharides. In particular, the molecular weight of the alginate and its loading level have an impact on the material's performance, as well as the loading of the divalent metal salt and its solubility, which affects the cross-linking of the gel. Alginate is often combined with other polysaccharides that can sigificantly modify the properties of the gel, and can optimise alginate for use in different biological applications. It is also possible to combine alginate with sacrificial polymers, which can temporarily reinforce the 3D printed construct, but then be removed at a later stage. Other additives can be formulated into the gels to enhance performance, including nanomaterials that tune rheological properties, peptides to encourage cell adhesion, or growth factors to direct stem cell differentiation. The ease of formulating multiple components into alginate gels gives them considerable potential for further development. In summary, this review will facilitate the identification of different alginate-polysaccharide bioink formulations and their optimal applications, and help inform the design of second generation bioinks, allowing this relatively simple gel system to achieve more sophisticated control over biological processes.},

	abstract = {A bio-inspired hydrogel for 3D bioprinting of soft free-standing neural tissues is presented. The novel filler-free bioinks were designed by combining natural polymers for extracellular matrix biomimicry with synthetic polymers to endow desirable rheological properties for 3D bioprinting. Crosslinking of thiolated Pluronic F-127 with dopamine-conjugated ({DC}) gelatin and {DC} hyaluronic acid through a thiol–catechol reaction resulted in thermally gelling bioinks with Herschel–Bulkley fluid rheological behavior. Microextrusion 3D bioprinting was used to fabricate free-standing cell-laden tissue constructs. The bioinks exhibited flattened parabolic velocity profiles with tunable low shear regions. Two pathways were investigated for curing the bioink: chelation and photocuring. The storage modulus of the cured bioinks ranged from 6.7 to 11.7 {kPa}. The iron ({III}) chelation chemistry produced crosslinked neural tissues of relatively lower storage modulus than the photocuring approach. In vitro cell viability studies using the 3D bioprinted neural tissues showed that the cured bioink was biocompatible based on minimal cytotoxic response observed over seven days in culture relative to control studies using alginate hydrogels. Rodent Schwann cell-, rodent neuronal cell-, and human glioma cell-laden tissue constructs were printed and cultured over seven days and exhibited comparable viability relative to alginate bioink controls. The ability to fabricate soft, free-standing 3D neural tissues with low modulus has implications in the biofabrication of microphysiological neural systems for disease modeling as well as neural tissues and innervated tissues for regenerative medicine.},

Specifically, we determine how matrix composition, print path and speed, and nozzle diameter affect the yielded region within the matrix. By characterizing the velocity and strain fields and analyzing the dimensions of the yielded regions, we determine that scaling relationships based on the Oldroyd number, Od, exist between these dimensions and the rheological properties of the matrix materials and printing parameters. Finally, we use {EMB}3D printing to create complex architectures within an elastomeric silicone matrix.

	abstract = {3D cell printing is an emerging technology for fabricating complex cell-laden constructs with precise and pre-designed geometry, structure and composition to overcome the limitations of 2D cell culture and conventional tissue engineering scaffold technology. This technology enables spatial manipulation of cells and biomaterials, also referred to as ‘bioink’, and thus allows study of cellular interactions in a 3D microenvironment and/or in the formation of functional tissues and organs. Recently, many efforts have been made to develop new bioinks and to apply more cell sources for better biocompatibility and biofunctionality. However, the influences of printing parameters on the shape fidelity of 3D constructs as well as on cell viability after the cell printing process have been poorly characterized. Furthermore, parameter optimization based on a specific cell type might not be suitable for other types of cells, especially cells with high sensibility. In this study, we systematically studied the influence of bioink properties and printing parameters on bioink printability and embryonic stem cell ({ESC}) viability in the process of extrusion-based cell printing, also known as bioplotting. A novel method was established to determine suitable conditions for bioplotting {ESCs} to achieve both good printability and high cell viability. The rheological properties of gelatin/alginate bioinks were evaluated to determine the gelation properties under different bioink compositions, printing temperatures and holding times. The bioink printability was characterized by a newly developed semi-quantitative method. The results demonstrated that bioinks with longer gelation times would result in poorer printability. The live/dead assay showed that {ESC} viability increased with higher printing temperatures and lower gelatin concentrations. Furthermore, an exponential relationship was obtained between {ESC} viability and induced shear stress. By defining the proper printability and acceptable viability ranges, a combined parameters region was obtained. This study provides guidance for parameter optimization and the fine-tuning of 3D cell printing processes regarding both bioink printability and cell viability after bioplotting, especially for easily damaged cells, like {ESCs}.},

The morphological, mechanical, and rheological properties of various alginate hydrogels were characterized and responses of biosynthesis of cells encapsulated in each gel to the variation in cross-linking density were investigated. Desired outer shape of structure was maintained when the alginate solution was cross-linked with the applied method. The properties of alginate hydrogel could be tailored through applying various concentrations of {CaCO}3. The rate of synthesized {GAGs} and collagens was significantly higher in human chondrocytes encapsulated in the smaller pore structure than that in the larger pore structure. The expression of chondrogenic markers, including collagen type {II} and aggrecan, was enhanced in the smaller pore structure. It was found that proper structural morphology is a critical factor to enhance the performance and tissue regeneration.},

	abstract = {Bioprinting is an emerging technique for the fabrication of 3D cell-laden constructs. However, the progress for generating a 3D complex physiological microenvironment has been hampered by a lack of advanced cell-responsive bioinks that enable bioprinting with high structural fidelity, particularly in the case of extrusion-based bioprinting. Herein, this paper reports a novel strategy to directly bioprint cell-laden gelatin methacryloyl ({GelMA}) constructs using bioinks of {GelMA} physical gels ({GPGs}) achieved through a simple cooling process. Attributed to their shear-thinning and self-healing properties, the {GPG} bioinks can retain the shape and form integral structures after deposition, allowing for subsequent {UV} crosslinking for permanent stabilization. This paper shows the structural fidelity by bioprinting various 3D structures that are typically challenging to fabricate using conventional bioinks under extrusion modes. Moreover, the use of the {GPG} bioinks enables direct bioprinting of highly porous and soft constructs at relatively low concentrations (down to 3\%) of {GelMA}. It is also demonstrated that the bioprinted constructs not only permit cell survival but also enhance cell proliferation as well as spreading at lower concentrations of the {GPG} bioinks. It is believed that such a strategy of bioprinting will provide many opportunities in convenient fabrication of 3D cell-laden constructs for applications in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and pharmaceutical screening.},

	abstract = {3D bioprinting with cell containing bioinks show great promise in the biofabrication of patient specific tissue constructs. To fulfil the multiple requirements of a bioink, a wide range of materials and bioink composition are being developed and evaluated with regard to cell viability, mechanical performance and printability. It is essential that the printability and printing fidelity is not neglected since failure in printing the targeted architecture may be catastrophic for the survival of the cells and consequently the function of the printed tissue. However, experimental evaluation of bioinks printability is time-consuming and must be kept at a minimum, especially when 3D bioprinting with cells that are valuable and costly. This paper demonstrates how experimental evaluation could be complemented with computer based simulations to evaluate newly developed bioinks. Here, a computational fluid dynamics simulation tool was used to study the influence of different printing parameters and evaluate the predictability of the printing process. Based on data from oscillation frequency measurements of the evaluated bioinks, a full stress rheology model was used, where the viscoelastic behaviour of the material was captured. Simulation of the 3D bioprinting process is a powerful tool and will help in reducing the time and cost in the development and evaluation of bioinks. Moreover, it gives the opportunity to isolate parameters such as printing speed, nozzle height, flow rate and printing path to study their influence on the printing fidelity and the viscoelastic stresses within the bioink. The ability to study these features more extensively by simulating the printing process will result in a better understanding of what influences the viability of cells in 3D bioprinted tissue constructs.},

In this study, we applied numerical and analytical modeling to describe the fluid flow inside the printing head based on a Herschel–Bulkley model. The presented analytical calculation method nicely reproduces the results of Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation concerning pressure drop over the printing head and maximal shear parameters at the outlet. An approach with dimensionless flow parameter enables the user to adapt rheological characteristics of a bioink, the printing pressure and needle diameter with regard to processing time, shear sensitivity of the integrated cells, shape fidelity and strand dimension. Bioinks consist of a blend of polymers and cells, which lead to a complex fluid behavior. In the present study, a bioink containing alginate, methylcellulose and agarose ({AMA}) was used as experimental model to compare the calculated with the experimental pressure gradient. With cultures of an immortalized human mesenchymal stem cell line and plant cells (basil) it was tested how cells influence the flow and how mechanical forces inside the printing needle affect cell viability. Influences on both sides increased with cell (aggregation) size as well as a less spherical shape. This study contributes to a systematic description of the extrusion-based bioprinting process and introduces a general strategy for process design, transferable to other bioinks.},

However, the lack of ideal 3D bioprinting inks with outstanding printability and high structural fidelity, as well as cell-compatibility, has hindered the progress of extrusion-based 3D bioprinting for tissue engineering. In this study, novel self-healable pre-cross-linked hydrogel microparticles ({pcHμPs}) of chitosan methacrylate ({CHMA}) and polyvinyl alcohol ({PVA}) hybrid hydrogels are developed and used as bioinks for extrusion-based 3D printing of scaffolds with high fidelity and biocompatibility. The {pcHμPs} display excellent shear thinning when injected through a syringe and subsequently self-heal into gels as shear forces are removed. Numerical simulations indicate that the {pcHμPs} experience a plug flow in the nozzle with minimal disturbance, which favors a steady and continuous printing. Moreover, the {pcHμPs} show a self-supportive yield strength (540 Pa), which is critical for the fidelity of printed constructs. A series of biomimetic constructs with very high aspect ratio and delicate fine structures are directly printed by using the {pcHμP} ink. The 3D printed scaffolds support the growth of bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and formation of cell spheroids, which are most important for tissue engineering.},

	abstract = {The development and formulation of printable inks for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting has been a major challenge in the field of biofabrication. Inks, often polymer solutions with the addition of crosslinking to form hydrogels, must not only display adequate mechanical properties for the chosen application but also show high biocompatibility as well as printability. Here we describe a reproducible two-step method for the assessment of the printability of inks for bioprinting, focussing firstly on screening ink formulations to assess fibre formation and the ability to form 3D constructs before presenting a method for the rheological evaluation of inks to characterise the yield point, shear thinning and recovery behaviour. In conjunction, a mathematical model was formulated to provide a theoretical understanding of the pressure-driven, shear thinning extrusion of inks through needles in a bioprinter. The assessment methods were trialled with a commercially available crème, poloxamer 407, alginate-based inks and an alginate-gelatine composite material. Yield stress was investigated by applying a stress ramp to a number of inks, which demonstrated the necessity of high yield for printable materials. The shear thinning behaviour of the inks was then characterised by quantifying the degree of shear thinning and using the mathematical model to predict the window of printer operating parameters in which the materials could be printed. Furthermore, the model predicted high shear conditions and high residence times for cells at the walls of the needle and effects on cytocompatibility at different printing conditions. Finally, the ability of the materials to recover to their original viscosity after extrusion was examined using rotational recovery rheological measurements. Taken together, these assessment techniques revealed significant insights into the requirements for printable inks and shear conditions present during the extrusion process and allow the rapid and reproducible characterisation of a wide variety of inks for bioprinting.},

However, the survival of cells in the brain remains poor. Although the biological potential of neural stem cells ({NSCs}) is widely documented, the biomechanical effects of delivering cells through a syringe-needle remain poorly understood. We here detailed the biomechanical forces (pressure, shear stress) that cells are exposed to during ejection through different sized needles (20G, 26G, 32G) and syringes (10, 50, 250 µL) at relevant flow rates (1, 5, 10 µL/min). A comparison of 3 vehicles, Phosphate Buffered Saline ({PBS}), Hypothermosol ({HTS}), and Pluronic, indicated that less viscous vehicles are favorable for suspension with a high cell volume fraction to minimize sedimentation. Higher suspension viscosity was associated with greater shear stress. Higher flow rates with viscous vehicle, such as {HTS} reduced viability by {\textasciitilde}10\% and also produced more apoptotic cells (28\%). At 5 µL/min ejection using a 26G needle increased neuronal differentiation for {PBS} and {HTS} suspensions. These results reveal the biological impact of biomechanical forces in the cell delivery process. Appropriate engineering strategies can be considered to mitigate these effects to ensure the efficacious translation of this promising therapy.},
